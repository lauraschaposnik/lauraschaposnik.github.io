## Short bio (≈75 words)
Laura P. Schaposnik is an Argentine Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois Chicago. Her research sits at the intersection of geometry, topology, and mathematical physics, with a focus on moduli spaces of decorated bundles. She also leads applied work in network science and mathematical modeling. Her expertise spans geometric models at the extremes, bridging quantization of integrable systems with data‑informed models for complex networks and pattern formation. She is a PECASE (2025) awardee and NSF CAREER, Simons, and Humboldt Fellow.

## Long bio (≈150 words)
Laura P. Schaposnik is an Argentine Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois Chicago. Her research lies at the interface of geometry, topology, and mathematical physics, with a particular focus on the geometry of moduli spaces of decorated bundles and the integrable structures behind them. Alongside this pure work, she leads applied projects in network science and mathematical modeling, developing data‑informed approaches to contagion on graphs, reaction–diffusion pattern formation, and nature‑inspired optimization. Her expertise spans **geometric models at the extremes**, connecting advances in the **quantization of integrable systems** with models for **complex networks and patterns**. Prof. Schaposnik received the **Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE, 2025)**, as well as an **NSF CAREER** award, a **Simons Fellowship**, and a **Humboldt Fellowship**. She is deeply engaged in mentoring and outreach, including the development of bilingual STEM resources for young readers.
