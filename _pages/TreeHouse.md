I always loved tree houses, always wanted to have a tree house, make a tree house, play in a tree house, live in a tree house? So we started building tree houses... 

<h1 id="Tree House #1"> Our front yard Tree House </h1>

When we moved to Belden in 2024 I made a very little front garden tree house for the boys during the first months we lived in the house, and it's been a big hit with them and their friends!

By the front tree house, I made a Little Free Library (we called it the <a href="https://www.thetreehouselibrary.com/">The Treehouse Library</a> )

<h1 id="Tree House #2"> Our back yard Tree House </h1>

Now that we marked the one year anniversary of living in Belden, and we have gaged a bit which plants grow where, how to optimize our garden and deck use, etc, we decided to make a backyard tree house, which is now almost finished, ready for our boys and their friends enjoy this spring, summer and hopefully into the winter! 

 It all started with some rough plans, and a first list of wood pieces needed. That list then expanded when we needed a ladder and the boys were happy to come with me to get the second batch.

The back wall was made on the ground since it went right by the house edge, but the other walls were built on site.

After a couple of days of work we had a fairly good structure. 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include  figure.liquid path="https://lauraschaposnik.com/assets/img/woodwork/TH10.png" title="Tree House #2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include  figure.liquid path="https://lauraschaposnik.com/assets/img/woodwork/TH12.png" title="Tree House #2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
        <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include  figure.liquid path="https://lauraschaposnik.com/assets/img/woodwork/TH14.png" title="Tree House #2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>


And soon after we were able to put all the walls, working windows and a vinyl window and vinyl roof!  By the time James came back from his 10 days in England, the house was so pretty! He helped putting the roof and the grass underneath and now it's almost done!
