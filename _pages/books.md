After reading hundreds of children books with my sons, I decided to start writing and illustrating my own children books, in an attempt to combine this with my research and the educator inside me. You can see my work   related to   <a href="#ene">Ene's book series</a>, <a href="#raccoon">Raccoon's book series</a> and <a href="#azul">translation work</a> below. The latest book, out in January 2023, is a book for young readers on [Sonia Kovalevsky's life](https://www.amazon.com/Potential-Inspire-Kovalevskys-Mathematical-Journey/dp/B0BRJZ182H?ref_=ast_sto_dp).

### [The potential to inspire…](https://www.amazon.com/Potential-Inspire-Kovalevskys-Mathematical-Journey/dp/B0BRJZ182H?ref_=ast_sto_dp)

 

<i>The Potential to Inspire: Sonia Kovalevsky's Mathematical Journey</i> is a poetic tale that takes us through the inspiring path of Sonia Kovalevsky, the first woman to receive a PhD and become a mathematics professor. Sonia Kovalevsky, who lived in the 19th century, became the first woman to obtain a doctorate in mathematics, the first woman appointed to a full professorship in Northern Europe, and one of the first women to work for a scientific journal as an editor. Sonia grew up in Russia, and her name was Со́фья Васи́льевна Ковале́вская, which translates into Sofia/Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya or Sophie/Sonia Kovalevsky. We have chosen the latter variation of her name since we developed this book inspired by the Sonia Kovalevsky Days for girls in math which originated within the Association of Women in Mathematics of the United States of America.

<h1 id="ene">Ene and the Magic…  </h1>
 

Ene is a curious little mouse who explores magic places and discovers new worlds. Through the adventures of Ene, I hope to teach bilingual words (Spanish-English) on different topics. 
I am working on these books in collaboration with [Cecilia La Rosa](https://www.instagram.com/cecilialarosa.ilus/) (Illustrator).

## [Reaching for the stars (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1737058472/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_4P5WBNZJMAVM0E3M977K?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

 
My husband [James Unwin](https://unwin.people.uic.edu/James_Unwin.html) wrote his first children's book in 2021 titled  <b>Reaching for the Stars</b>,  illustrated by mathematician [Maylis Limouzineau](https://lucky8locke.ultra-book.com/). It is an engaging story about a cat that goes through several transformations on their journey to become a star in the sky. Children and adults will love to read and reread this beautiful illustrated tale featuring Cats, Tigers, Zebras and Reindeer. A thrilling journey of self-discovery that teaches children the importance of having the courage to follow their dreams and to become their best selves.

I had the honor of translating the book to Spanish whilst preserving the beautiful rhyme, making the book available in Spanish and English, as well as in a bilingual version.
