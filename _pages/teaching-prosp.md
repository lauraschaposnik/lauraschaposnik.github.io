If you are considering joining my university and are looking for opportunities to work in geometry, here is some information which you might find useful. For some broad as well as particular open problems in my area, students may enjoy reading about [Higgs bundles](http://aimpl.org/spectralhiggs/1/) from one of the [workshops](https://schapos.people.uic.edu/Research.html) that I organized.

## Prospective post-docs 

<b>Post-doc positions for German based researchers:</b> If you are based in Germany and would like to work as a post-doctoral researcher with me, please send me an email at schapos@uic.edu. The Alexander von Humboldt foundation has a program through which you could come to UIC for 1~2 years.
