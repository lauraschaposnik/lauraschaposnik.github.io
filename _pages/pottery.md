I grew up watching my aunt Viviana, my father's sister, making beautiful art and beautiful statues and pottery. Early on during my childhood I'd spend afternoons in her studio doing some of her pottery and art classes with other students, and then having dinner all together at her home. After so many decades, I found myself wanting to learn something new - so in 2025 I started a wheel-throwing class here in Lincoln Park, Chicago.
