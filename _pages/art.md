I grew up in a house full of art, and was taken to museums whenever we had a chance -- and since I was very little I learned art from my aunt <a href="https://www.instagram.com/viviana_schaposnik/?hl=en">Viviana Schaposnik<a/>, who is an artist and architect, and from her daughters <a href="https://scholar.google.com.ar/citations?user=LnpO2GwAAAAJ&hl=es">Clara Gallardo<a/>, an artist and architect too, and <a href="http://www.paulagallardo.it/">Paula Gallardo<a/>, an artist and musician.  


 When the COVID-19 pandemic started, I found peace in painting. Below you can see some of my <a href="#watercolors">watercolor</a> done following Sarah Cray's   <a href="https://www.letsmakeart.com/">Let's make art</a>,  and some <a href="#digital">digital</a> art done on Procreate. Finally, I've recently started experimenting with <a href="#AIart">AI inspired art</a>.

 <h1 id="AIart"> AI inspired art  </h1>


<a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALLÂ·E 2</a> <i> is a new AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. </i> I have recently started investigating the different results one can gate through varied prompts, and then finishing or editing the illustrations using <a href="https://procreate.art/">Procreate</a>. In particular, I've been interested in creating different types of vintage patterns that can be used for home design.

 <h1 id="digital"> ATCs  </h1>
 
Artist trading cards (ATCs) are miniature pieces of art that are traded around the world. Artists create, trade and collect art at organized "swap" events, either in person or online. The only official rule for ATCs is the size: 2.5" x 3.5".

<a href="https://www.strathmoreartist.com/cards-atc.html"> How did the movement start?</a>
``In 1997, M. Vanci Stirnemann, a Swiss artist, created 1200 cards by hand as part of an exhibit. On the last day, he invited others to create their own cards and trade with him during the closing reception. The movement took off, and today, there are ATC swaps in almost every major city around the world. There are also many online swaps.''
