I grew up in a house full of art, and was taken to museums whenever we had a chance -- and since I was very little I learned art from my aunt <a href="https://www.instagram.com/viviana_schaposnik/?hl=en">Viviana Schaposnik<a/>, who is an artist and architect, and from her daughters <a href="https://scholar.google.com.ar/citations?user=LnpO2GwAAAAJ&hl=es">Clara Gallardo<a/>, an artist and architect too, and <a href="http://www.paulagallardo.it/">Paula Gallardo<a/>, an artist and musician.  


 When the COVID-19 pandemic started, I found peace in painting. Below you can see some of my <a href="#watercolors">watercolor</a> done following Sarah Cray's   <a href="https://www.letsmakeart.com/">Let's make art</a>,  and some <a href="#digital">digital</a> art done on Procreate. Finally, I've recently started experimenting with <a href="#AIart">AI inspired art</a>.

 <h1 id="patterns"> <a href="https://www.spoonflower.com/profiles/schaposstyle">Patterns</a>  </h1>

I love coming up with new ideas of patterns that could exist, fabrics that could be made, and just art that could be explored - and in particular using <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a> and ChatGPT. Sometimes whilst we walk and explore places we dream of things that could be made - and then we ask Midjourney to imagine it... since we also like building things with fabric, I have put many of our patterns in <a href="https://www.spoonflower.com/profiles/schaposstyle">Spoonflower</a> where I (and others) can buy products with those patterns. Here are some examples:

Have you always wanted a pattern for your walls or your dinning table (or anywhere else!) and you couldn't find it? send me a line and I'll try and help - I like challenges!

 <h1 id="AIart"> 2023' AI inspired art  </h1>


<a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALLÂ·E 2</a> <i> was a new AI system in 2023 that could create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. </i> I have recently started investigating the different results one can gate through varied prompts, and then finishing or editing the illustrations using <a href="https://procreate.art/">Procreate</a>. At the time I was   interested in creating different types of vintage patterns that can be used for home design.

 <h1 id="digital"> ATCs  </h1>
 
Artist trading cards (ATCs) are miniature pieces of art that are traded around the world. Artists create, trade and collect art at organized "swap" events, either in person or online. The only official rule for ATCs is the size: 2.5" x 3.5".

<a href="https://www.strathmoreartist.com/cards-atc.html"> How did the movement start?</a>
``In 1997, M. Vanci Stirnemann, a Swiss artist, created 1200 cards by hand as part of an exhibit. On the last day, he invited others to create their own cards and trade with him during the closing reception. The movement took off, and today, there are ATC swaps in almost every major city around the world. There are also many online swaps.''
