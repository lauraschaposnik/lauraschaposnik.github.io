I grew up watching my mother, father and my brother gardening, they were all so good at it! our family home felt like a beautiful rainforest, with a mix of dessert and spiced peppers. From the largest ever seen queen of the night, to beautiful magnolias and azaleas, plants were everywhere.

The garden itself felt like a magical garden, both for us grown ups as well as for the kids that visited my father's home.

 Now that we have our own home, we have started learning how to grow plants - from flowers to fruit and vegetables, and making our new fruit trees thrive.  And the terrace  - which hosted my father's mud oven - was always full of magic too - my father and brother always made sure there were beautiful flowers and plants by my bedroom's terrace door.

<h1 id="base"> Our sunroom and the spicy pepper plants  </h1>
 
We started to grow 10 different pepper plant varieties in the spring 2024, using ultraviolet lights and careful set up - it didn't take long for us to get an overwhelming amount of plants!

    </div>

Soon after we chose those we wanted to keep, we offered a bunch to our friends and neighbours, and proceeded to take even more care of those we'd have for a long time. It wasn't long until it all started to flower and produce amazing peppers!

Now it's our first full   winter in the house (2024-2025) we are keeping our plants thriving indoors!

<h1 id="grill"> Our Japanese garden    </h1>

 
Our front yard was a bit dull when we bought the house, so we have created our own version of a Japanese zen garden, with a touch of happy childhood... we have a river of rocks, a wooden bridge, an enchanted tree house and a little free library.

<h1 id="grill"> Our fruit trees  and bushes  </h1>

 
During the summer 2024 we started using Fast Growing Trees and we could't be happier, both with the plants we have received but also with their efficient resolution of any problems we've encountered in the now many many times we bought things from them. We are so happy with our big Lemon Tree, our Chicago hardy Fig Tree, our Blueberry bushes, our Fig leaf palm trees, and so many more. The smaller plants have been thriving so much that we've been able to create many others through little cuttings. And the best part of all - being able to eat our own grown fruit!
