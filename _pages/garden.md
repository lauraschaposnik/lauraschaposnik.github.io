I grew up watching my mother, father and my brother gardening, they were all so good at it! our family home felt like a beautiful rainforest, with a mix of dessert and spiced peppers:

 Now that we have our own home, we have started learning how to grow plants - from flowers to fruit and vegetables, and making our new fruit trees thrive.

<h1 id="base"> Our sunroom and the spicy pepper plants  </h1>
 
We started to grow 10 different pepper plant varieties in the spring 2023, using ultraviolet lights and careful set up - it didn't take long for us to get an overwhealming amount of plants!    

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/base2.jpeg" title="Our indoor plants" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Soon after we chose those we wanted to keep, we offered a bunch to our friends and neighbours, and proceeded to take even more care of those we'd have for a long time.

Now it's our first full   winter in the house (2024-2025) we are keeping our plants thriving indoors!

<h1 id="grill"> Our Japanese garden    </h1>

 
Our front yard was a bit dull when we bought the house, so we have created our own version of a Japanese zen garden, with a touch of happy childhood... we have a river of rocks, a wooden bridge, an enchanted tree house and a little free library.

During the summer 2024 we started using Fast Growing Trees and we could't be happier, both with the plants we have received but also with their efficient resolution of any problems we've encountered in the now many many times we bought things from them. We are so happy with our big Lemon Tree, our Chicago hardy Fig Tree, our Blueberry bushes, our Fig leaf palm trees, and so many more. The smaller plants have been thriving so much that we've been able to create many others through little cuttings. And the best part of all - being able to eat our own grown fruit!
