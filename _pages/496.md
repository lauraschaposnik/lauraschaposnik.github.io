## What is MATH 496?

**MATH 496 (Independent Study)** is a for‑credit, student‑driven research or reading project. You will choose a focused topic, meet regularly to set milestones, and produce a substantial final output. Projects can be **theoretical**, **computational**, **expository**, or **applied**, and may range from a research‑style mini‑paper to a polished expository article, a reproducible code notebook, or a small public‑facing resource.

Typical areas include (but are not limited to): geometry & topology, Higgs bundles and moduli spaces, integrable systems & quantization, networks and contagion models, reaction-diffusion and pattern formation, data visualization for mathematical communication, and bilingual STEM outreach grounded in rigorous mathematics.

## Who can enroll?

- Motivated **undergraduates** or **graduate students** with sufficient background for the chosen topic.
- You should be comfortable with independent reading and writing in LaTeX. Prior coursework will vary by project; we will agree on an appropriate scope at the outset.
- Enrollment requires **permission of the instructor** and a short **one‑page proposal** (template below).

## Credits, Workload & Deliverables
Choose **2** or **3** credits based on your goals and bandwidth. We will right‑size the topic accordingly.

### 2 credits (reading/expository or scoped computational project)
- **Time expectation:** consistent weekly effort across the term.
- **Deliverables:**
  1. 1‑page **proposal** (Week 1).  
  2. Short **milestone plan** (Week 2).  
  3. **Progress memo** mid‑term (≈2 pages).  
  4. Final **expository note** (≈6–10 pages) *or* a **reproducible code notebook** with a clear README.  
  5. **Lightning talk** (5–8 minutes).

### 3 credits (deeper research/exposition or extended computational study)
- **Time expectation:** larger weekly commitment across the term.
- **Deliverables:**
  1. 1‑page **proposal** (Week 1).  
  2. Detailed **milestone plan** (Week 2).  
  3. **Mid‑term report** (≈4–6 pages) with preliminary results.  
  4. Final **paper‑style write‑up** (≈10–15 pages) *or* a **code + data + analysis package** with documentation and figures.  
  5. **Short talk** (10–12 minutes) and optional **poster**.

> ✱ Page counts are guidelines; quality, rigor, and clarity matter more than length. We will tailor expectations to your topic.

## Timeline (suggested)
- **Week 0–1:** Topic discussion; submit proposal; enroll.  
- **Week 2:** Agree on milestones and reading list; set meeting rhythm.  
- **Weeks 3–6:** Execute plan; regular check‑ins (notes/logs).  
- **Mid‑term:** Progress memo/report.  
- **Weeks 7–12:** Deepen results; draft figures/examples; iterate.  
- **Final weeks:** Deliver final write‑up & talk; archive materials (PDF + code).

## How to propose a 496
Email **schapos@uic.edu** with subject **“MATH 496 — [Your Name] — Proposal”** and include:

1. **Your name, program, year** (and relevant courses).  
2. **Credit choice** (2 or 3).  
3. A **1‑page proposal** summarizing:  
   - Topic & motivation (what/why)  
   - Initial questions or goals (how you’ll make progress)  
   - Expected outputs (paper, code, visuals, talk)  
   - Initial references (2–5 items)  
4. A short **availability note** for weekly meetings.

I will reply with feedback and, if approved, permission to register and a shared checklist for the term.

## Sample project ideas
- **Geometry & Physics:** Spectral data for rank‑2 Higgs bundles; toy models of exact WKB; monodromy and character varieties (expository or computational).  
- **Networks & Dynamics:** SIR/Voter models on graphs; influence maximization heuristics; reaction–diffusion pattern formation in 2D domains.  
- **Computational & Visualization:** Reproducible notebooks for a classical theorem; interactive visualizations of graph algorithms; curated figure sets for teaching.  
- **Outreach (rigorous & bilingual):** Short, math‑faithful modules for K‑12 on symmetry, tilings, or networks; data‑driven infographics with clear pedagogy.

If you bring your own idea, great : let’s scope it together.

## Expectations & policies (high level)
- **Meetings:** Please keep appointments or reschedule ahead of time. Send a brief agenda or log in advance of each meeting.  
- **Academic integrity:** Cite all sources; if you adapt code or figures, credit clearly.  
- **Accessibility:** If you need accommodations, contact the UIC Disability Resource Center and let me know so we can plan accordingly.  
- **Archiving:** Final materials (PDF, slides, and if applicable, code/data) should be submitted in an organized folder.
