I work on **geometric models at the extremes**, bridging pure advances in *quantizing integrable systems* with *data‑informed models* for complex networks and pattern formation. This page gives a one‑screen tour with a few representative papers in each lane and a link to the full list.

## Geometry & Quantization (pure)
Moduli of Higgs bundles, branes, spectral data, and the integrable system structure behind them.

- **Nonabelianization of Higgs bundles** — *J. Differential Geom.* (2014, with N. Hitchin). A geometric mechanism that turns abelian data back into non‑abelian Higgs‑bundle data via spectral curves. <br>
  <small>JDG 97(1), 79–89.</small>

- **Higgs bundles and (A,B,A)-branes** — *Comm. Math. Phys.* (2014, with D. Baraglia). Constructs (A,B,A) branes via real structures and relates them to real integrable systems on the moduli space. <br>
  <small>CMP 331, 1271–1300.</small>

- **Spectral data for U(m,m)-Higgs bundles** — *IMRN* (2015). Introduces explicit spectral data and invariants for U(m,m)‑Higgs bundles, giving a concrete picture of the moduli. <br>
  <small>IMRN 2015(11), 3486–3498.</small>

- **Higgs bundles and exceptional isogenies** — *Adv. Theor. Math. Phys.* (2016, with S. Bradlow). Relates Higgs‑bundle moduli across groups via low‑dimensional exceptional isogenies using fiber products of spectral curves. <br>
  <small>ATMP 20(5), 1143–1190.</small>

- **Higgs bundles—Recent applications** — *Notices of the AMS* (2020). A concise expository snapshot of how the Hitchin fibration and integrable structure echo across mathematics and physics. <br>
  <small>Notices 67(5), 625–635.</small>

## Networks & Patterns (applied)
Contagion on graphs, coupled dynamics, and nature‑inspired algorithms.

- **A carbon‑aware ant colony system (CAACS) for sustainable GTSP** — *Scientific Reports* (2025, with M. Lin). Bi‑objective routing balances solution quality and estimated carbon impact, offering a practical sustainability lens on GTSP.  

- **Modeling social cohesion with coupled oscillators: synchrony & fragmentation** — *Chaos, Solitons & Fractals* (2025, with S. Hsu & R. Dunbar). A semicoupled‑oscillator model explains when activity schedule mismatch fractures groups—and how bonding mitigates it.  

- **Correlations between COVID‑19 and dengue** — *Scientific Reports* (2023, with P. Bergero & G. Wang). Neural‑network models link signals across diseases and climates to improve dengue estimates where data are scarce.  

- **A Physarum swarm Steiner‑tree algorithm** — *Scientific Reports* (2022, with S. Hsu & F.I. Schaposnik Massolo). A slime‑mold‑inspired, explore‑and‑fuse strategy that competes with leading solvers and handles obstacles naturally.  

- **Modified age‑structured SIR model for COVID‑19‑type viruses** — *Scientific Reports* (2021, with V. Ram). Shows how contact patterns and age structure shape outcomes and policy trade‑offs.
