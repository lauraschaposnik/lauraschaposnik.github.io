I grew up watching my father and my brother building things, sometimes helping myself, but mostly just admiring them. Here are some photos from the last 20 years:

 Now that we have our own home, we have started learning how to build thinks ourselves. We first learned how to set  <a href="#base"> a foundation </a> for a shed, which then became very useful at the time of building  <a href="#grill"> an Argentinian grill with bricks </a> in our back yard in Lincoln Park.

<h1 id="base"> Building a Solid Foundation  </h1>
 
We decided to build a shed in our front yard, and so we needed a solid foundation to put it on.   
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/base2.jpeg" title="Nikolay helped a lot" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

We had to excavate a trench of undisturbed soil for the required bearing, lay the Step 1 and Step 2 foundation bags, then the cement tiles making sure they were horizontal (enough) and then make the shed. 


 
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/base1.jpeg" title="Set things up for a day of work" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
            {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/base3.jpeg" title="And the base is finished!" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
        <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
                {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/shed.jpeg" title="The shed finished" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
 
We set up things to make the foundation during one day. A beach tent kept Nikolay entertained with toys, and allowed him to watch ups build things from scratch. He now wants to be an Architect and a builder! (and a scientist and a painter and so much more!).

<h1 id="grill"> Parrilla Argentinian    </h1>

 
We have a beautiful back yard (not so common in Lincoln Park, we're indeed very lucky!
 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/set0.jpeg" title="Our back yard" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

To honor our Argentinian heritage, and to continue my father's tradition of Sunday Asados, we needed to build an Argentinian Parrilla there. 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/grill.jpeg" title="The plans" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

After making several sketches, we proceeded to make a lego model, of course. 

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/grill0.jpeg" title="Our new tools" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/grill2.jpeg" title="James learning new skills" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

We then emptied the whole space from plants and soil, it was quite some work, and prepared the ground for a 5' foundation base. 

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/set3.jpeg" title="The ground is ready" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

Our fantastic contractor Maurizio (and his team, and his uncle!) have been teaching us so much! 

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/brick1.jpeg" title="The foundation bags are ready" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

Once the the foundation was dry, we were ready to start making the legs and the counter.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/brick/brick3.jpeg" title="Half way there" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

  <div class="row">

    </div>
</div>

After the upper level was done, we waited for a warmish December day to add the fire bricks that should make the grill ready to be used next spring!
