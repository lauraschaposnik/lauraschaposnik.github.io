With the deepest sadness, my brother Fidel and I bid farewell to our father, [Fidel Arturo Schaposnik](https://lauraschaposnik.com/fidel.a.schaposnik/), who passed away early Saturday July 29th, 2023 in La Plata, Argentina after a month-long battle in the intensive care unit following a hemorrhagic stroke.
