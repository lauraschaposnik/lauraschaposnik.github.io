	year={2022},
	abstract={In recent years it has become evident the need of
understanding how failure of coordination imposes
constraints on the size of stable groups that highly
social mammals can live in. We examine here the
forces that keep animals together as a herd and
others that drive them apart. Different phenotypes
(e.g. genders) have different rates of gut fill, causing
them to spend different amounts of time performing
activities. By modeling a group as a set of semicoupled
oscillators on a disc, we show that the
members of the group may become less and less
coupled until the group dissolves and breaks apart.
We show that when social bonding creates a stickiness,
or gravitational pull, between pairs of individuals,
fragmentation is reduced. Dedicated to my father Prof. Fidel A. Schaposnik on the occasion of his 75th birthday. },

	abstract={Reliable forecasting of the housing market can provide salient insights into housing investments. Through the reinterpretation of housing data as candlesticks, we are able to utilize some of the most prominent technical indicators from the stock market to estimate future changes in the housing market. By providing an analysis of MACD, RSI, and Candlestick indicators (Bullish Engulfing, Bearish Engulfing, Hanging Man, and Hammer), we  exhibit their statistical significance in making predictions for USA data sets  (using Zillow Housing data), as well as for a stable housing market, a volatile housing market, and a   saturated market by considering the data-sets of Germany, Japan, and Canada. Moreover, we show  that bearish indicators  have a much higher statistical significance then bullish indicators, and we further illustrate how   in less stable or more populated countries, bearish trends are only slightly more statistically present compared to bullish trends. Finally, we show how the insights gained from our trend study can help consumers save significant amounts of money.},

In this context, this paper shows how a neural network approach can incorporate Dengue and COVID-19 data as well as external factors (such as social behaviour or climate variables), to develop predictive models that could improve our knowledge and provide useful tools for health policy makers. Through the use of neural networks with different social and natural parameters, in this paper we define a <i> Correlation Model </i> through which we show that the number of cases of COVID-19 and Dengue have very similar trends. We then illustrate the relevance of our model by extending it to a Long short-term memory model (LSTM)  that incorporates both diseases, and using this to  estimate Dengue infections by using COVID-19 data   in countries that lack sufficient Dengue data.},

Physarum is a unicellular slime mold with the ability to form networks and fuse with other Physarum organisms. We use the simplicity and fusion of Physarum to create large swarms which independently operate to solve the Steiner problem. The Physarum Steiner tree algorithm then utilizes a swarm of Physarum organisms which gradually find terminals and fuse with each other, sharing intelligence. The algorithm is also highly capable of solving the obstacle avoidance Steiner tree problem and is a strong alternative to the current leading algorithm. The algorithm is of particular interest due to its novel approach, rectilinear properties, and ability to run on varying shapes and topological surfaces.},

The CELL model is a unicellular automaton introduced in the recent work of Gunji et al. in 2008, that models Physarum's amoeboid motion, tentacle formation, maze solving, and network creation. In the present paper, we extend the CELL model by spawning multiple CELLs, allowing us to understand the interactions between multiple cells, and in particular, their mobility, merge speed, and cytoplasm mixing. We conclude the paper with some notes about applications of our work to modeling the rise of present day civilization from the early nomadic humans and the spread of trends and information around the world. Our study of the interactions of this unicellular organism should further the understanding of how Physarum polycephalum communicates and shares information.},

	abstract={Singular limits of 6D F-theory compactifications are often captured by T-branes, namely a non-abelian configuration of intersecting 7-branes with a nilpotent matrix of normal deformations. The long distance approximation of such 7-branes is a Hitchin-like system in which simple and irregular poles emerge at marked points of the geometry. When multiple matter fields localize at the same point in the geometry, the associated Higgs field can exhibit irregular behavior, namely poles of order greater than one. This provides a geometric mechanism to engineer wild Higgs bundles. Physical constraints such as anomaly cancellation and consistent coupling to gravity also limit the order of such poles. Using this geometric formulation, we unify seemingly different wild Hitchin systems in a single framework in which orders of poles become adjustable parameters dictated by tuning gauge singlet moduli of the F-theory model.},

One of the most interesting aspects of the duality revolution in string theory is the understanding that gauge fields and matter representations can be described by intersection of branes. Since gauge theory is at the heart of our description of physical interactions, it has opened the door to the geometric engineering of many physical systems, and in particular those involving Higgs bundles. This note presents a curated overview of some current advances and open problems in the area, with no intention of being a complete review of the whole subject.},

	abstract={The development of mobile phones has largely increased human interactions. Whilst the use of these devices for communication has received significant attention, there has been little analysis of more passive interactions. Through census data on casual social groups, this work suggests a clear pattern of mobile phones being carried in people's hands, without the person using it (that is, not looking at it). Moreover, this study suggests that when individuals join members of the opposite sex there is a clear tendency to stop holding mobile phones whilst walking. Although it is not clear why people hold their phones whilst walking in such large proportions (38 percent of solitary women, and 31 percent of solitary men), we highlight several possible explanation for holding the device, including the need to advertise status and affluence, to maintain immediate connection with friends and family, and to mitigate feelings related to anxiety and security.},

We identify these representations with rigid geometric figures, namely pairs of polygons: one in the Lie algebra of a compact group and the other in its complexification. To such data, we associate an explicit meromorphic Higgs bundle on a genus-g Riemann surface, where g is the number of loops in the comet, thereby embedding the Nakajima quiver variety into a Hitchin system on a punctured genus-g Riemann surface (generally with positive codimension). We show that, under certain assumptions on flag types, the space of generalized hyperpolygons admits the structure of a completely integrable Hamiltonian system of Gelfand-Tsetlin type, inherited from the reduction of partial flag varieties. In the case where all flags are complete, we present the Hamiltonians explicitly. We also remark upon the discretization of the Hitchin equations given by hyperpolygons, the construction of triple branes (in the sense of Kapustin-Witten mirror symmetry), and dualities between tame and wild Hitchin systems (in the sense of Painlevé transcendents).},

We generalize this by introducing F(t)-bootstrap percolation, a time-dependent process where the number of neighbouring vertices which need to be infected for a disease to be transmitted is determined by a percolation function F(t) at each time t. After studying some of the basic properties of the model, we consider smallest percolating sets and construct a polynomial-timed algorithm to find one smallest minimal percolating set on finite trees for certain F(t)-bootstrap percolation models. },

Once an initial set of vertices of G is randomly selected to be carrying a gossip (e.g. to be infected), the gossip propagates to a new vertex provided it is transmitted by a minimum threshold of vertices with different labels. By considering random graphs, which have been shown to closely represent social networks, we study different properties of the T-BP model through numerical simulations, and describe its implications when applied to rumour spread, fake news, and marketing strategies.},

Mathematical models on d-ary tree graphs were recently shown to be particularly effective for modelling epidemics in simple networks. To account for symmetric relations, we generalize this to a new type of networks modelled on d-cliqued tree graphs, which are obtained by adding edges to regular d-trees to form d-cliques. This setting gives a more realistic model for epidemic outbreaks originating within a family or classroom and which could reach a population by transmission via children in schools. Specifically, we quantify how an infection starting in a clique (e.g. family) can reach other cliques through the body of the graph (e.g. public places). Moreover, we propose and study the notion of a safe zone, a subset that has a negligible probability of infection.},

In the present paper we incorporate disymmetrons to obtain a geometric classification of large icosahedral viruses formed by regular penta-,tri-, and disymmetrons, giving all mathematically consistent and theoretically possible solutions.
